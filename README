20-Sim provides a C++ Code Generator which can automatically convert a complete 20-Sim model or submodel into C++ code.
The template in this repository will generate code for the ROS framework.

= INSTALL =
To install the template copy the contents of this git repository into the Ccode folder:
 cd %PATH_TO_20_SIM%/Ccode
 git clone https://YuryBrodskiy@github.com/YuryBrodskiy/20SimROSCodeGeneration.git

= USAGE = 
To use the code generation feature in 20-Sim go to 'Model->Start Simulator' to open a new simulator window. Then from the simulator window go to menu 'Tools-> Real Time Toolbox -> C-Code Generation' to display a window with list of templates. Choose ROS node.

Re-mapping node and topic names (input/output) is described here:
* http://www.ros.org/wiki/Remapping%20Arguments - for command line startup
* http://www.ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML - for launch files, see Section "6.2 A more complicated example"

= ADVANCED FEATURES = 
An important feature of the generated node is the possibility to influence the configuration parameters and communication ports after the code was generated.

The configuration of the created node is described in the config/%SUBMODEL_NAME%_config.xxsim XML file created at the moment of code generation.
The XML configuration file contains the following:
+ Initial values required to correctly start computation
	- Initial state of the node
	- Configuration of the computation
+ Description of the component interface
	- Input/Output ports -> Data flow communication
	- Configuration properties -> Runtime introspection, runtime changes of configuration
+ Other information about the computation model, e.g.  physical quantities (not in use at the moment)
